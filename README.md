# Recipe generator

This is a project for the TDT4310 - Intelligent Text Analytics and Language Understanding course. I will use data from matprat.no to generate new recipes, using _state of the art_ machine learning techniques.

If you do not want to download the code and run it yourself, you can run it on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jonathanbrooks/tdt4310-project?scriptVersionId=95533378) with pretrained data!ðŸ˜€

**PS: Use generated recipes at own risk.**
